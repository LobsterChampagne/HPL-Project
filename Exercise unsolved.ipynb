These decisions can depend on the purpose the dataset is released for: age may be a relevant variable in some scientific studies, but less so in others. Very often however, datasets are released for a general purpose or the purpose may be difficult to obtain. In these cases, algorithms may be used that try to reach k-anonymity with the least amount of suppression and generalization possible. These algorithms typically involve trying a lot of combinations of generalization levels and suppression criteria, before an optimal solution is chosen."

    "Turning a dataset into a k-anonymous (and possibly l-diverse or t-close) dataset is a complex problem, and finding the optimal partition into k-anonymous groups is an NP-hard problem. Fortunately, several practical algorithms exists that often produce \"good enough\" results by employing greedy search techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we will explore the so-called \"Mondrian\" algorithm (see link above), which uses a greedy search algorithm to parition the original data into smaller and smaller groups (if we plot the resulting partition boundaries in 2D they resemble the pictures by Piet Mondrian, hence the name).\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm assumes that we have converted all attributes into numerical or categorical values and that we're able to measure the \"span\" of a given data attribute $X_i$ (we'll explain that in more detail later).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Partitioning\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm proceeds then as follows to partition the data into k-anonymous gorups:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Initialize the finished set of partitions to an empty set $P_{finished} = \\{\\}$.\n",
    "2. Initialize the working set of paritions to a set containing a partition with the entire dataset $P_{working} = \\{\\{1, 2,\\dots ,N\\}\\}$.\n",

    "      * Check if the resulting partitions are valid according to our k-anonymity (and possibly additional) criteria.\n",
    "      * If yes, add the two new partitions to the working set and break out of the loop.\n",
    "  * If no column produced a valid split, add the original partition to the set of finished partitions.\n",
    "5. Return the finished set of partitions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Aggregation\n",
    "\n",
    "After obtaining the partitions we still need to aggregate the values of the quasi identifiers and the sensitive attributes in each k-anonymous group. For this, we can e.g. replace numerical attributes with their range (e.g. \"age: 24-28\") and categorical attributes with their union (e.g. \"employment-group: [self-employed, employee, worker]\"), though other aggregations are possible. Methods like [Anatomy](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.156.9150&rep=rep1&type=pdf) even preserve the micro-data in each group, which increases re-identification risk though.\n",

With the dataset generation method discussed here you can use the resulting datasets just as you would use a normal dataset though, so there's really nothing special about the anonymized data here.\n",
