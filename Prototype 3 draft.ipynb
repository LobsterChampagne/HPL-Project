    "\n",
    "Health information is widely acknowledged to be sensitive personal information. Information of this type may contain facts about an individual that can be used by insurance companies, future employers or others against the benefit of the person involved. For this reason, in many countries and jurisdictions, gathering, storing and publishing such data by third parties is limited by laws and regulations. In general, the gist of this type of legislation is twofold. For a third party to be allowed to process health data, either:\n",
    "\n",
    "* the person the information is about has given permission for usage\n",
    "* the data is changed in such a way that it is not possible to determine the identity of the individual\n",
    "\n",
    "Although health data is sensitive in the sense described above, large health datasets can offer a wealth of information to scientists and researchers, for example in determining the effects of specific medication or finding correlations between lifestyle and disease. However, datasets with this type of information may not be used without satisfying either of the conditions mentioned.\n",
    "\n",
    "Especially for large existing datasets, it can be very difficult, if not completely infeasible, to obtain permission from each individual in the dataset. In order to use this data without jeopardizing an individuals privacy and stay within legal boundaries, the data needs to be changed in such a way that it is impossible to determine the identity of individual the information is about. This process is commonly referred to as **anonymization**.\n",
    "\n",
    "A common solution for anonymization is simply removing all values from the dataset that identify a person directly, e.g. remove a person's name and SSI. Sometimes a variant known as pseudonimization is used, where this information is not removed, but replaced by a specific ID number. This ID number can only be traced back to the person involved through a Trusted Third Party (TTP)\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on context, these methods have advantages and disadvantages. One important observation however, is that very often the second condition is not adequately satisfied: it is still possible to infer the identity of the person involved from the given data."

Furthermore, many people may be indistinguishable (or equivalent) within the dataset, but some records will still have a unique combination of values. As an example, someone with a very uncommon profession and being above 100 years old is still easily re-identified in most large datasets."
