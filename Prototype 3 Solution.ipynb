    "* One record was completely suppressed\n",
    "* The age value for each record was classified into one of two categories: 50- or 50+\n",
    "* The occupation value for each record was generalized into Yes or No\n",

    "* Suppression: leaving out records that have a very unique combination of attribute values\n",
    "* Generalization: making values more generic, so that more records share the same value\n",
    "\n",
    "In applying these techniques, decisions have to be made about which records to suppress and to what extent the columns should be generalized. These decisions can depend on the purpose the dataset is released for: age may be a relevant variable in some scientific studies, but less so in others. Very often however, datasets are released for a general purpose or the purpose may be difficult to obtain. In these cases, algorithms may be used that try to reach k-anonymity with the least amount of suppression and generalization possible. These algorithms typically involve trying a lot of combinations of generalization levels and suppression criteria, before an optimal solution is chosen."

Methods like [Anatomy](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.156.9150&rep=rep1&type=pdf) even preserve the micro-data in each group, which increases re-identification risk though.\n",

A problem that might happen in k-anonymity is that all people in a k-anonymous group possess the same value of the sensitive attribute.

    "T-closeness is a further refinement of l-diversity group based anonymization that is used to preserve privacy in data sets by reducing the granularity of a data representation. The t-closeness model extends the l-diversity model by treating the values of an attribute distinctly by taking into account the distribution of data values for that attribute. T-closeness requires that the distribution of a sensitive attribute in any equivalence class is close to the distribution of the attribute in the overall table.\n",
