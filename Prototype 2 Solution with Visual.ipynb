    "1. Be able to anonymize data and analyse anonymous data for re-identification\n",

    "2. Learn the concepts of k-anonymity, l-diversity, t-closeness and function creep as examples of privacy related topics\n",

These decisions can depend on the purpose the dataset is released for: age may be a relevant variable in some scientific studies, but less so in others. Very often however, datasets are released for a general purpose or the purpose may be difficult to obtain. In these cases, algorithms may be used that try to reach k-anonymity with the least amount of suppression and generalization possible. These algorithms typically involve trying a lot of combinations of generalization levels and suppression criteria, before an optimal solution is chosen."
